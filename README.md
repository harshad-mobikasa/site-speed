# Head Core Integration

This repository demonstrates how to include a shared **head-level snippet**
at the very start of the `<head>` tag.

The implementation shown here is for **demo purposes only**.
You do NOT need to copy the entire `theme.liquid` file into your project.

## What You Need to Do

Only two steps are required:

1. Add the `head-core` file to your project
2. Render / include it at the **start of the `<head>` tag**
