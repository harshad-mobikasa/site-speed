## Site Speed Setup

Copy the code from `site-speed-html` file and paste it
**at the very beginning of the `<head>` tag** in the HTML/layout file.

⚠️ Important:
- Place it immediately after `<head>`
- Do not place it after CSS, JS, or third-party scripts
- This setup is required for site speed optimization tasks
